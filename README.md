# cfg-website
The primary reason for creating this website is to assist people living or visiting different London Boroughs (32 to be exact) in order to find information more readily.
Although different boroughs have their own websites, it would be very useful if we could create a UX (user experience) that is similar across the boroughs and this will lead to better information dispersal and successful outcomes.
