# cfg-website
The primary reason for creating this social enterprise website is to assist people living or visiting different London Boroughs in order to find information about support, social events and volunteering in the community more readily.
Although different boroughs have their own websites, it would be very useful if we could create a UX (user experience) that is similar across the boroughs and this will lead to better information dispersal and successful outcomes. 
The London Borough map is an open source map from https://jsmaps.io/  and is free to download and use.
